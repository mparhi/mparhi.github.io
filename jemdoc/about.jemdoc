== Short Bio
I recently graduated with a M.S. in [http://www.ece.utexas.edu/  Electrical Engineering] from
[https://www.utexas.edu/ The University of Texas at Austin] (UT) under the supervision
of Professor [http://www.ece.utexas.edu/people/faculty/ahmed-tewfik Ahmed H. Tewfik]. While at UT, I worked on classifying imaginary vowels from EEG Brain-Computer Interface signals using Deep Learning models. 

Prior to joining graduate school, I received a B.E.E in [http://ece.umn.edu/ Electrical Engineering]
